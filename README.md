Predicting On-Base Percentage in Major League Baseball: A Regression Analysis Approach

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of predicting on-base percentage (OBP) for Major League Baseball (MLB) players using various regression models. The analysis covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning to identify the most effective models. Ridge Regression emerged as the topperforming model. Future work may involve more advanced models and additional features to enhance predictive capabilities.
